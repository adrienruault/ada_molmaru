The indicator on young people neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET) provides information on young people aged 15 to 24 who meet the following two conditions: 
(a) they are not employed (i.e. unemployed or inactive according to the International Labour Organisation definition) and 
(b) they have not received any education or training in the four weeks preceding the survey. Data are expressed as a percentage of the total population in the same age group and sex, excluding the respondents who have not answered the question 'participation to education and training'. 
Data come from the European Union Labour Force Survey.
