# Panama Paper : Where does the money come from ?

# Abstract

Panama papers is one of the biggest leaks in journalistic history. It reveals the secretive offshore companies used to hide wealth, evade taxes and commit fraud by the world's dictators, business tycoons and criminals from 1977 to 2015.
In this project we wish to highlight how global companies or private individuals are able to hide from any form of control using geoplotical context to their advantage. We aim to show our results through an interactive map so we can identify countries conductive to such behaviours. We want to provide a efficent way to visualise geographical entity belonging and connections. We will rely on the panama dataset available on https://www.occrp.org/en/panamapapers/database website. The dataset contains the persons responsible for almost 500'000 offshore companies, foundations and trusts, leading to over 1'000'000 connections between officers, intermediaires and entities. With such an analysis, we could build a most corrupt countries ranking weighted by corrupt companies, politicians and private individuals.

A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

# Dataset
The dataset is given in .csv format and neo4j display format. On one hand,  we might use the csv database to build our work. This data base is composed of four files listing each entities, officers, connections, adresses and intermediaries for a total weight of 352 Mo. On the other hand, neo4j display app offers a good way to explore the data and might be of good help to verify our analysis, we will have to  get familiar with neo4j app since it allowes very fast computation times.

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
