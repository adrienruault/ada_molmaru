# Panama Papers : Where does the money come from ?

# Abstract

The Panama papers released in 2015 is the biggest leak of financial information in history. It came from the Panamanian corporate service company Mossack Fonseca. The leak revealed a substantial amount of illegal activities including fraud and tax evasion. It especially uncovered illegal financial activities carried out by world's biggest wealth holders, politicians and companies.

This project aims to compile the information provided by the Panama papers to show the geographical structure of offshore activities. We intend to do so thanks to an interactive map showing connections between the different entities and officers concerned by the leak. The idea being to make the information shown on the map scalable. As a concrete example, the user could query the structure of the offshore activities concerning a particular officer or intermediary but he/she could also scale up by querying offshore connections about more general entities like countries, tax heavens, continents, etc..


# Research questions

- Which countries were the most involved in the offshore activities unveiled in the leak?
- What are the relationships between countries and tax heavens? 
- Are there evidences of privileged relationships between some countries and tax heavens?
- Is there an evolution in time of the tax heavens activity?


# Dataset
The dataset is taken from is given in .csv format and neo4j display format. On one hand,  we might use the csv database to build our work. This data base is composed of four files listing each entities, officers, connections, adresses and intermediaries for a total weight of 352 Mo. On the other hand, neo4j display app offers a good way to explore the data and might be of good help to verify our analysis, we will have to  get familiar with neo4j app since it allowes very fast computation times.

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
